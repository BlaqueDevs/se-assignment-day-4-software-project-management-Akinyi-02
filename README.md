Beaurocratic change management process
  
  

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile works well for projects that prize learning and are seeking or refining their product-market fit. The speed and flexibility of Sprints dovetail nicely with a continuous feedback loop and ongoing experimentation and tweaking. It can thrive is one with a clearly articulated and well-supported product strategy. When everyone is aligned around objectives, goals, and KPIs, there’s more comfort in giving individual teams the freedom and independence to work toward achieving them rapidly.

Waterfall is particularly useful for large, complex projects with very specific and unchanging requirements. Development teams will be less resistant to detailed product requirements documents and design specifications since that’s what’s expected.It can also be easier to map out dependencies and structure the overall project plan in a waterfall setting
